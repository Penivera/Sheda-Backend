"""Request and response shapes for Collections.

Two conventions run through this file and both exist to stop the API quietly
lying about money.

Amounts are strings, always. They are u128 atomic units of a stablecoin, and
a JSON number is an IEEE double, exact only up to 2**53.

A single unit price sits below that line: 18,000,000 naira at six decimals
is 1.8e13, comfortably inside it. What does not is everything computed from
one. The vault's income accumulator is scaled by 1e18 and runs past 1e25 in
ordinary use, a holder's claim is `balance * acc_per_share` before it is
divided back down, and a raise beyond roughly 9 billion naira crosses the
line by itself. Serialising any of those as a number loses the low digits
somewhere between here and the client, and nobody finds out until a holder
is shown a figure the chain disagrees with. One rule for every amount is
cheaper than remembering which ones happen to be safe.

Scores are absent, also always. The directory returns the counts a ranking is
computed from and never the ranking. The app tells people Sheda does not
adjust these numbers, and the only way that stays true is if the server has
no number to adjust.
